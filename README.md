## Known Limitations

### Adoption Requests (Local Only)

Due to the frontend-only nature of this exam, adoption requests are **not persisted to the backend** and do not sync between users or browsers.

Instead, they are stored using [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) with `localStorage` under the hood.

#### Limitations:

* Adoption requests are only visible **in the browser and session where they were created**.
* Owners will not see incoming requests unless using the same localStorage state.
* If you clear site data or switch browser, requests will disappear.
* This is intentional and documented as part of the frontend scope.

✨ However, the `adoptionStatus` of each pet **is updated via Noroff's API** and *does* sync globally. This ensures that pets marked as **Adopted** are consistently filtered or hidden for all users.
